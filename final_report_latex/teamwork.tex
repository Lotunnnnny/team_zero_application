As a team, we decided on our general roles from the start of the project. However, we each still shifted between roles to get an understanding of the system, as well as to even out the workload, throughout implementation. As there are 4 main parts to our system, we have one dedicated ``expert" member for each part (Android client, web client, server application, database). These roles blurred particularly during implementation of the encryption protocols, as well as towards the end of the project. 

We decided to have weekly face-to-face meetings to stay up to date and have visual clarity of progress, draw out plans and confirm goals for the following week. In addition, we communicated regularly via WhatsApp chat, and put most important application related information on GitHub wiki or Issues. 

In summary, our methods of team collaboration included:
\begin{itemize}
\item Weekly meetings for discussion and planning (occasional sub-weekly meetings for pair programming and brainstorming ideas) 
\item Whatsapp group chat for regular daily communication
\item Google docs for document draft and brainstorm collaboration
\item Trello for task management
\item Git and GitHub for software development version control
\begin{itemize}
\item GitHub Wiki for relevant Client - Server communications information
\item GitHub Issues for feature or bug development discussions
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
